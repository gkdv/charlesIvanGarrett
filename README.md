# IMS inventory management system

## About 
This app is set up to be a lightweight inventory control program. Users can create, read, and update customer/inventory
information within the database.

## Customer page
The customer page is intended for creating a new customer profile as well as viewing customers already in the 
database. The user input for new customers uses validation for each required form input. Each customer 
has a relational database to their orders.

## Validate.js

We used validate.js on the front end to make sure information sent to the back end is in the appropriate format. E.g. quantity is an integer, email is proper email.

## Handlebars templating

Handlebars and its structure was used for the front end templating.

## ESlint and Prettier

We used combination of ESlint and prettier to make sure everyone's code adhere to the agreed upon standard and structure.
